# What is shell?

Interface between the user and the operating system resources

# How the system finds and executes commands

Commands run in the command line are executables, in order for these executables to work as recognized commands by the terminal, they need to be part of locations found in the environment variable `$PATH`

If a command is not located in any of the locations in `$PATH`, the user must then reference the full path of it.

# Quotting

 "" = Escape all special characters except for: $ (dollar) ` (backtick) / (slash)

 '' = Escape all special characters

# Escaping single character

 \ = Escape the next character
 ```bash
    FELIPE=felipe
    echo $FELIPE
    echo \$FELIPE
 ```

# Environment Variables

How to define a local environment variable

```bash
    VARIABLE_NAME=value
    echo $VARIABLE_NAME
```

To make environment variable global, use `export` command
```bash
    export VARIABLE_NAME
```

Print all declared variables
```bash
    set
```

Print global variables
```bash
    env
```

Print all directories found in $PATH variable on separated lines
> `tr` is a command that replaces one character by another
```bash
    echo $PATH | tr ':' '\n'
```

> Use command `type` with `set` and `env` and notice how "set" is a builtin command and "env" is an external command.

How to remove environment variable
```bash
    unset VAR_NAME
```

Some important environment variables

```bash
    # Stores the file location of the history command line execution)
    HISTFFILE

    HISTFILESIZE

    # Logged user in the current session)
    LOGNAME

    # Stores external binaries locations so that they can be recognized by the command line without having to use absolute path
    PATH

    # Current directory
    PWD

    # Previous directory
    OLDPWD

    # Shell type being used
    SHELL

    # Defines the terminal type
    TERM

    # Current user name
    USER

    DISPLAY

    # Shell prompt appearence
    PS1
```
> Use `echo` to see environment variables values, e.g: echo $USER

- Dynamic variables
```bash
    # Returns current process PID
    $$

    # Returns the last process executed in background
    $!

    # Returns the last process exit code
    #?

    # Returns current user home
    ~

    # Returns username's home
    ~<username>
```

# Executing multiple commands

Using `&&` (and) operator
It only executes the second command when the first is successful

Using `||` (or) operator
It only executes the second command when the first is failed.

# Executing commands from the history output

Using `!!` executes the last used command.
Using `!<number>` executes the command in history by its number identifier.
Using `!<string>` executes the last command with the passed string.

Cleaning history
```bash
    history -c
```

Searching for commands in history
```bash
    ctrl + R
```

```bash
    Press TAB key twice
```

    man <command_name>
```
> For Built-in commands, use man bash

```

Returns the description of a given command

```

Return system information
```bash
    uname
```

Creating aliases
```bash
    alias lt='ls /tmp'
```

List all defined aliases
```bash

```
