# Managing Processes
Managing processes in a Linux system involves monitoring and controlling the execution of programs and commands. The "ps" command displays information about currently running processes, while "top" provides a real-time, dynamic view of system processes, including their CPU and memory usage. Other commands, such as "kill", "pkill", and "killall", allow you to terminate or signal processes for various purposes. These tools are essential for managing system resources, troubleshooting issues, and optimizing performance.

## ps
```bash
    # Returns running processes in the current terminal
    ps

    # Returns running processes in user mode (It displays information in more detail)
    ps -u

    # Returns all running processes in the system, including non associated with current terminal
    ps -x

    # Same as above but including all users and also in user mode
    ps -uax

    # Same as above but displays the processes relation in a tree format
    ps -uaxf

    # Return processes from a specific process name
    ps u -C <process name>

    # Filter output using grep to match any word in the output
    ps -uax | grep <word>
```

## pstree
```bash
    # Displays processes in tree format
    pstree

    # Same as above but displays the processes ID
    pstree -p
```

## pgrep
```bash
    # Returns the process ID based on name or other attributes passed as argument
    pgrep bash

    # Same as above but for specific username
    pgrep -u root
```

## top
```bash
    # Displays processes information in real time
    top

    # Sort by memory usage
    Shift + M

    # Sort by CPU usage
    Shift + P

    # Sort by username
    u + <username>

    # Sort by execution priority
    r

    # Displays limited number of processes
    n + <number>

    # Kill a process
    k + <PID>

    # Display all options
    ?
```

## top -b
```bash
    # Displays information in batches of data
    top -b

    # Same as above but with 3 seconds of delay for each batch
    top -b -d3

    # Same as above but run only 3 times
    top -b -d3 -n3
```

## kill
```bash
    # Send SIGTERM signal to a specific process PID
    kill <PID>

    # Send SIGKILL signal to a specific process PID
    kill -SIGKILL <PID>

    # List all signals available for kill command
    kill -l
```

## killall
```bash
    # Kill all processes related to firefox where the current user is a onwer
    killall firefox
```

## pkill
```bash
    # Works similarly to killall, but allows for momre flexible matching based on pattern or attirbute

    # The below command sends siginal 1 (SIGHUP) to firefox process with a specific username
    pkill -l 1 firefox -u <username>
```

## uptime
```bash
    # Displays for how long the system has been running
    uptime
```

## free
```bash
    # Displays quantity of memory and quantity of swap utilized by the system
    free

    # Displays in megabytes
    free -m

    # Displays in gigabytes
    free -g
```

## screen
Screen is a useful linux application that allows administrators to create and manage tabs internally in a shell environment, it is particularly useful if you're in a remote SSH session.
```bash
    # Make sure to update / install screen application
    sudo apt-get install screen

    # Start screen
    screen

    # Create a new shell screen
    ctrl + a + c

    # Go to next screen
    ctrl + a + n

    # List screens
    screen -ls

    # Detach current screen
    screen + a + d

    # Close screen
    exit

    # Return the last used screen
    screen -r

    # Create a new screen running a given command
    screen <command>
```

## Running processes in foreground and background
```bash
    # Starts vim in foreground, it takes control on the shell
    vim <filename>.txt

    # Starts vim in the background, it does not take control of the shell
    vim <filename>.txt &

    # Stop a process that is currently running in fogreground
    ctrl + z
```

## jobs
```bash
    # Returns processes running in background
    jobs -l
```

## bg
```bash
    # Set the last job to background, this is particularly useful for when you want to stop a currently running process in foreground with "ctrl + z" and then executes bg next to send it to background.
    bg

    # Optionally you can set other jobs by specifying its number
    bg <number>
```

## fg
```bash
    # Set the last job to foreground
    fg

    # Similarly as bg, you can also choose the job number
    fg <number>
```

## nohup
```bash
    # Run a process in the background and prevent it to be terminated even after the terminal is closed

    # All the output will be sent to a file called "nohup.out" in the same directory where the command was executed from
    nohup ./script.sh &
```

## watch
```bash
    # Run date command each 2 seconds and keep a log of it on screen
    watch date

    # Same as above but set delay for 5 seconds instead of the 2 seconds default
    watch -n5 date
```

## tmux
Tmux is similar to "screen" but newer and it contains some additional features such as vertical and horizontal window splitting, detaching and reattaching sessions from different terminal or SSH connection.
```bash
    # Make sure to install / update tmux
    sudo apt-get install tmux

    # Create new window
    ctrl + b + c

    # Go to next window
    ctrl + b + n

    # Go to previous window
    ctrl + b + p

    # Go to lastest window
    ctrl + b + l

    # Go to window by window ID
    ctrl + b + <window ID>

    # Displays a navigation list of windows to select from
    ctrl + b + w

    # Create a new panel from window vertically
    ctrl + b + %

    # Create a new panel horizontally
    ctrl + b + ""

    # Change panel
    ctrl + b + <arrow key>

    # Rotate through each panel
    ctrl + b + o

    # Resize panels
    [hold] ctrl + b + <arrow key>

    # Detach from session
    ctrl + b + d

    # List tmux sessions
    tmux ls

    # Attach to a tmux session
    tmux attach -t <tmux session ID>

    # Create new tmux connection and give it a name
    tmux new -s <name>

    # Kill a tmux session
    tmux kill-session -t <session id>
```
