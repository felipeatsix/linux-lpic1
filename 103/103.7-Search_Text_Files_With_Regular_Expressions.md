# Search text files with regular expressions
Filtering text files with regular expressions in Linux is a powerful way to extract and manipulate specific information from log files, configuration files, and other types of system data. System administrators can use regular expressions to search for patterns in text files, filter and extract relevant data, and perform complex search and replace operations. Regular expressions provide a flexible and efficient way to automate tasks and analyze system data, making it easier to identify issues, troubleshoot problems, and maintain system performance and security.

## grep
```bash
    # Search for word "linux" in <filename>.txt
    grep linux <filename>.txt

    # Search for word "linux" in <filename>.txt and return the number of ocurrences
    grep -c linux <filename>.txt

    # Retun number of ocurrences of the word "linux" from all .txt files under the current directory
    grep -c linux *.txt

    # To ignore case sensitive, use the parameter -i
    grep -c -i linux *.txt

    # To search recursively, use the parameter -r
    grep -c -i -r linux *.txt

    # Revert the argument, using the parameter -v
    # Return only lines that does not contain the word "linux"
    grep -v linux <filename>.txt
```

## egrep
Runs grep with expanded regular expression feature
```bash
    # Match words that starts with "b" finishes with "g" and contains "a" or "e" or "i" in between.
    egrep "b[aei]g" <filename>.txt

    # Match for zero or more ocurrences of the last character "g"
    egrep "b[aei]g*" <filename>.txt
    
    # Match at least one or more ocurrences of the last character "g"
    egrep "b[aei]g+" <filename>.txt

    # Match the last character "g" zero or one time
    # Matches with: "big", "ba", "bege" and more...
    # Does not match with: "bigger" because "bigger" contains "g" more than one time
    egrep "b[aei]g?" <filename>.txt

    # Match any character after the word "hell" one time.
    egrep "hell."

    # Match any character after the word "hell" at least one or multiple times.
    egrep "hell.+"
    
    # Same as above, but this time include a range of the entire alphabet in between first and last letters.
    egrep "b[a-z]g" <filename>.txt

    # Returns lines that contains the word "Linux" at the beginning of the line
    egrep "^Linux" <fileName>.txt

    # Returns lines that contains the word "Linux" at the end of the line
    egrep "Linux$" <fileName>.txt

    # Returns all blank lines
    egrep "^$" <fileName>.txt
```

### Reminder
> Regular expressions are also useful in the command `sed`
