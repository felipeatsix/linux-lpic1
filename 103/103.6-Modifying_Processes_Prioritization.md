# Processes Prioritization Management
Process prioritization is the act of assigning different levels of priority to running processes on a system. Prioritizing processes is important to ensure that critical processes get the resources they need to function properly and that lower-priority processes do not interfere with their operation. Managing process priorities is a key responsibility of system administrators to maintain system stability, performance, and availability.

## How to read processes priority using `top` command
### PR Column
PR = Priority
Contains an internal identifier that tells the process priority at the moment.

### NI Column
NI = Nice
The property that allows admins to configure processes priority.

## nice
Sets a process priority, range from -20..+19
> The smaller the number the higher the priority
> Only root can increase process priority, while non root users can only decrease priority
```bash
    # Start firefox browser in background with priority of 15
    nice -n 15 firefox &
    
    # Same as above but ommiting -n parameter
    nice -15 firefox &

    # Start firefox browser in background with high priority as root
    nice -n -15 firefox &

    # Same as above but omitting -n parameter
    nice --15 firefox &
```

## renice
Adjust priority of an already running process.<br>

`Attention`: Pay much attention that the syntax of renice differs from the `nice` command when providing the priority code, here positive numbers should be provided without dashes.
```bash
    # Adjust a process priority to 8
    renice -n 8 <PID>

    # Same as above but ommiting -n parameter
    renice 8 <PID>
    
    # Adjust a process priority to -8
    renice -n -8 <PID>

    # Same as above but ommiting -n parameter
    renice -8 <PID>

    # Set all processes from a specific username to 5
    renice -n 5 -u <username>

    # Sset all processes from a specific user group to 5
    renice -n 5 -g <user group>
```
