# Basic file management
Basic file management for Linux involves using various commands and tools to navigate, create, copy, move, and delete files and directories. The command line interface (CLI) provides powerful tools for managing files, including commands such as cd to change directories, mkdir to create new directories, cp to copy files, mv to move or rename files, and rm to delete files. These commands can be combined with various options and flags to provide more control over file management tasks.

## cd
```bash
    # Move to another directory
    cd <directory name>

    # Move one directory before
    cd ..

    # Move to previous directory
    cd -

    # Move to home of current login
    cd ~
```

## ls
```bash
    # List files
    ls

    # List files including hidden files
    ls -a

    # List files with byte size information
    ls -lh

    # List files recursively
    ls -lr

    # List files using a wildcard
    ls <string>*

    # returns a file or a directory called "felipe" if exists.
    ls fe?ipe

    # It returns folder1, folder2, folder3, if exists.
    ls folder[123]

    # It won't return folder1, folder2 and folder 3.
    ls folder[!123]

    # Same as the first one, but specifying a range.
    ls folder[1-3]

    # It will return folder called "folder" or "Folder" if exists.
    ls {F,f}older
```

## file
```bash
    # Show file type
    file <file name>
```

## cp
> Always use the argument `-i` to avoid overwriting files in the destination accidentally.
```bash
    # Copy files from source to destination
    cp -i <source> <destination>

    # Use wildcard to copy all files that starts with word "students"
    cp -i students* /tmp/

    # Copy a directory using -r argument
    cp -i -r folderName/ /tmp

    # Copy and preserve file characteristics (date time creation, etc...)
    cp -i -p <source> <destination>

    # Copy and rename file at same time
    cp -i <source/fileName> <destination/newFileName>
```

## mv
> The command MV is also used for RENAMING files and directories
```bash
    # Does almost everything as CP command, except for arguments -r and -p
    mv -i <source> <destination>

    # Rename a file in the current directory
    mv -i <folderName> <newFolderName>
```

## touch
> Touch also updates already existent files, such as last modification time, this can be a good resource for some processes that requires to update such information.
```bash

    # Create a new file
    touch filename

    # Update an existent file last modified time
    touch -m filename

    # Update an existent file last access time
    touch -a filename

    # Update an existent file last access time with a predefined fake date
    # NOTE: date time format is -> yyyyMMddhhmm
    touch -t 202301011000 filename
```

## rm
> Be careful when using rm as root, files will be deleted without further notice Remove a file
```bash
    rm <fileName>

    # Remove a directory
    # Note: This command will successfully remove a directory within its contents
    # There's another command "rmdir" which removes only empty directories.
    rm -r <folderName/>
```

## mkdir
```bash
    # Create a new directory
    mkdir <directoryName>

    # Create a new directory inside an existent directory
    mkdir <existentDirecotry/newDirectory>

    # Create two or more new directories at once
    mkdir -p <newDirectory/newSubDirectory>

    # Same as above
    mkdir --parents <newDirectory/newSubDirectory>
```

## rmdir
```bash
    # Remove an empty directory
    rm <directoryName>

    # Remove two or more empty directories at once
    rm -p <directory1/directory2>
```

## find
```bash
    # Search files
    find /home -name <fileName>

    # Search files using a wildcard
    find /home -name <fileName>*

    # Search files with a specific user name
    find /home -user <userName>

    # Search files that were changed in the last day
    find /home -ctime -1
```

## tar
> tar `DOES NOT necessarily compact files`, it groups them only, unless you specify compacting flags.<br><br>
    -c : Create  
    -v : Verbose  
    -p : Keep file details and permissions  
    -x : Extract  
    -f : Specify file name  

    Compacting flags  

    -z : gzip
    -j : bzip2
    -J : xz

```bash
    # Create a new grouped file
    tar cf <file name>

    # Same as above but adding arguments -v for verbose and -p to preserve permissions
    tar cvpf <file name>.tar

    # Same as above but using a wildcard for compacting multiple files
    tar cvpf <file name>*.tar

    # Group and compact files using gzip algorithm
    tar zcvpf <file name>.tgz

    # Group and compact files using bzip2 algorithm
    tar jcvpf <file name>.tbz

    # Group and compact files using xz algorithm
    tar Jcvpf <file name>.txz

    # Extract a gzip file
    tar zxvf <file name>.tgz

    # Extract a bzip2 file
    tar jxvf <file name>.tbz

    # Extract a xz file
    tar Jxvf <file name>.txz
```

## gzip, bzip2, xz
> A compacted file will take place over the original file, to create a new compacted copy and keep the original file, use the argument `-K`
```bash
    # Compact a grouped file
    gzip <file name>.tar
    bzip2 <file name>.tar
    xz <file name>.tar

    # Create a compacted copy of a grouped file
    gzip -k <file name>.tar
    bzip2 -k <file name>.tar
    xz -k <file name>.tar

    # Extract a compacted file
    gzip -d <file name>.tar.gz
    bzip2 -d <file name>.tar.gz
    xz -d <file name>.tar.gz

    # Same as above
    gunzip backup.tar.gz
    bunzip backup.tar.gz
    unxz backup.tar.gz
```
