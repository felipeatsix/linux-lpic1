# Applying filters to files and text files
Filtering files and text files in Linux involves using various commands and tools to process and manipulate data within files. This can be useful for extracting specific information, searching for patterns, or modifying the contents of files.

## cat
Return text file content
```bash
    cat <file name>

    # Returns content with numbered lines
    cat -n <file name>

    # Does not enumerate blank lines
    cat -b <file name>

    # Merge multiple blank lines into only one blank line
    cat -s <file name>

    # Shows hidden characters (tab, end of lines, etc...)
    cat -A <file name>
```
> The command `nl` does the same thing as "cat -b"

Returns non duplicated lines from a file
```bash
    cat <file name> | uniq

    # Returns only what's duplicated in the file
    cat <file name> | uniq -d

    # Enumerates how many ocurrences the same line content has in the file
    cat <file name> | uniq -c
```

Reading compressed files with variantes of the `cat` command
```bash
    xzcat file.txt.xz
    bzcat file.txt.bz2
    zcat file.txt.gz
```

## tac
Return text file content in inverse order
```bash
    tac <file name>
```
> Note how "tac" is "cat" in inverse way

## head
Returns a portion of the file content
```bash
    head <file name>

    # Returns only two first lines
    head -2 <file name>
```
> By default it returns first 10 lines

## tail
Returns a portion of the file in the inverse order
```bash
    tail <file name>

    # Return the last lines and keep watching it
    tail -f <file name>
```
> tail -f is a useful command for live logging

## less
Returns paginated content
```bash
    less <file name>
```

## wc
Read the quantity of lines, words and characters
```bash
    wc <file name>

    # Only lines
    wc -l

    # Only words
    wc -w

    # Only characters
    wc -c
```

## sort
Sorting files
```bash
    # Sort file alphabetically
    sort <file name>

    # Sort by the second field(e.g: last name)
    sort -k2 <file name>

    # Sort by the second field when delimiter is ':'
    sort -t ':' -k 2

    # Sort by the second field when delimiter is ':' and numeric
    sort -t ':' -k 2n

```

## od
Returns content in octal dump format
```bash
    od <file name>
```

## join
Combine two files using an index
```bash
    # Consider the files content

    ## Names ##
    # 1 Felipe
    # 2 Cicely

    ## Height ##
    # 1 1,75
    # 2 1,63

    join <names.txt> <height.txt>

    # output
    # 1 Felipe 1,75
    # 2 Cicely 1,63
```

## paste
Combine two files lines
```bash
    paste <file name>
```

## split
Divide a file into more files
```bash
    # Creates new files by each 20 lines
    split -l20 <file name> <new file name>
```

## tr
Replace or delete characters using `tr` command
```bash
    # make all upper case Using letter range
    cat <file name> | tr a-z A-Z

    # Same as above
    cat <file name> | tr [:upper:] [:lowercase]

    # Replace A by E
    cat <file name> | tr A E

    # Delete all upper case A characters
    cat <file name> | tr -d A

    # Delete all blank spaces
    cat <file name> | tr -d [:blank:]

    # Squeeze character "i", e.g: returns "Felipe"
    # Every e character will be replace by upper case "E" and every i character will be replaced by upper case "I".
    echo "feliiiipe" | tr -s i
    cat <file name> | tr ei EI
```

Converting line termination from Windows (CRLF) to Unix (LF) using `tr` command
```bash
    tr -d "\r" < filename.txt > newfile.txt
    #or
    cat filename | tr -d "\r" > newfile.txt
```

## cut
Cut portions of text using the `cut` command
```bash
    # Returns the first 5 characters of each line
    cut -c1-5 <file name>

    # Do the same as above.
    cut -c-5 <file name>

     # Returns characters starting from index 5 of each line
    cut -c5- <file name>

    # Returns index 1, 2 and 5 of each line
    cut -c1,2,5 <file name>

    # Set delimiter as "blank space" and return "field 1" of each line
    cut -d" " -f1 <file name>
```

## sed
Using `sed` command for editing text
```bash
    # Replaces every first ocurrence of 'oldName' in each line
    sed 's/oldName/newName/' <file name>

    # Using /g tells the command to change all ocurrences of 'oldName' on each line.
    sed 's/oldName/newName/g' <file name>

    # Deletes lines from 3 to line 5
    sed '3,5 d' <file name>

    # Deletes the whole line that contains the word 'name'
    sed '/name/d' <file name>
```

## Checksums - md5sum, sha256sum and sha512sum
How to verify file integrity (checksum)
```bash
    # <Filename> can be a .txt file that must contain a relation of hash and file name which coincides with the filename being verified that must exist on same folder of the operation.
    md5sum -c <filename>
    sha256sum -c <filename>
    sha512sum -c <filename>
```
